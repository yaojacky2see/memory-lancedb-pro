# Memory Extraction Criteria

## What is worth remembering?
- Personalized information: Information specific to this user, not general domain knowledge
- Long-term validity: Information that will still be useful in future sessions
- Specific and clear: Has concrete details, not vague generalizations

## What is NOT worth remembering?
- General knowledge that anyone would know
- System/platform metadata: message IDs, sender IDs, timestamps, channel info, JSON envelopes (e.g. "System: [timestamp] Feishu...", "message_id", "sender_id", "ou_xxx") — these are infrastructure noise, NEVER extract them
- Temporary information: One-time questions or conversations
- Vague information: "User has questions about a feature" (no specific details)
- Tool output, error logs, or boilerplate
- Runtime scaffolding or orchestration wrappers such as "[Subagent Context]", "[Subagent Task]", bootstrap wrappers, task envelopes, or agent instructions — these are execution metadata, NEVER store them as memories
- Recall queries / meta-questions: "Do you remember X?", "你还记得X吗?", "你知道我喜欢什么吗" — these are retrieval requests, NOT new information to store
- Degraded or incomplete references: If the user mentions something vaguely ("that thing I said"), do NOT invent details or create a hollow memory

# Memory Classification

## Core Decision Logic

| Question | Answer | Category |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Who is the user? | Identity, attributes | profile |
| What does the user prefer? | Preferences, habits | preferences |
| What is this thing? | Person, project, organization | entities |
| What happened? | Decision, milestone | events |
| How was it solved? | Problem + solution | cases |
| What is the process? | Reusable steps | patterns |

## Precise Definition

**profile** - User identity (static attributes). Test: "User is..."
**preferences** - User preferences (tendencies). Test: "User prefers/likes..."
**entities** - Continuously existing nouns. Test: "XXX's state is..."
**events** - Things that happened. Test: "XXX did/completed..."
**cases** - Problem + solution pairs. Test: Contains "problem -> solution"
**patterns** - Reusable processes. Test: Can be used in "similar situations"

## Common Confusion
- "Plan to do X" -> events (action, not entity)
- "Project X status: Y" -> entities (describes entity)
- "User prefers X" -> preferences (not profile)
- "Encountered problem A, used solution B" -> cases (not events)
- "General process for handling certain problems" -> patterns (not cases)

# Three-Level Structure

Each memory contains three levels:

**abstract (L0)**: One-liner index
- Merge types (preferences/entities/profile/patterns): \`[Merge key]: [Description]\`
- Independent types (events/cases): Specific description

**overview (L1)**: Structured Markdown summary with category-specific headings

**content (L2)**: Full narrative with background and details

# Few-shot Examples

## profile
\`\`\`json
{
  "category": "profile",
  "abstract": "User basic info: AI development engineer, 3 years LLM experience",
  "overview": "## Background\\n- Occupation: AI development engineer\\n- Experience: 3 years LLM development\\n- Tech stack: Python, LangChain",
  "content": "User is an AI development engineer with 3 years of LLM application development experience."
}
\`\`\`

## preferences
\`\`\`json
{
  "category": "preferences",
  "abstract": "Python code style: No type hints, concise and direct",
  "overview": "## Preference Domain\\n- Language: Python\\n- Topic: Code style\\n\\n## Details\\n- No type hints\\n- Concise function comments\\n- Direct implementation",
  "content": "User prefers Python code without type hints, with concise function comments."
}
\`\`\`

## cases
\`\`\`json
{
  "category": "cases",
  "abstract": "LanceDB BigInt error -> Use Number() coercion before arithmetic",
  "overview": "## Problem\\nLanceDB 0.26+ returns BigInt for numeric columns\\n\\n## Solution\\nCoerce values with Number(...) before arithmetic",
  "content": "When LanceDB returns BigInt values, wrap them with Number() before doing arithmetic operations."
}
\`\`\`

# Output Format

Return JSON:
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "category": "profile|preferences|entities|events|cases|patterns",
      "abstract": "One-line index",
      "overview": "Structured Markdown summary",
      "content": "Full narrative"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- Output language should match the dominant language in the conversation
- Only extract truly valuable personalized information
- If nothing worth recording, return {"memories": []}
- Maximum 5 memories per extraction
- Preferences should be aggregated by topic`;
}

export function buildDedupPrompt(
  candidateAbstract: string,
  candidateOverview: string,
  candidateContent: string,
  existingMemories: string,
): string {
  return `Determine how to handle this candidate memory.

**Candidate Memory**:
Abstract: ${candidateAbstract}
Overview: ${candidateOverview}
Content: ${candidateContent}

**Existing Similar Memories**:
${existingMemories}

Please decide:
- SKIP: Candidate memory duplicates existing memories, no need to save. Also SKIP if the candidate contains LESS information than an existing memory on the same topic (information degradation — e.g., candidate says "programming language preference" but existing memory already says "programming language preference: Python, TypeScript")
- CREATE: This is completely new information not covered by any existing memory, should be created
- MERGE: Candidate memory adds genuinely NEW details to an existing memory and should be merged
- SUPERSEDE: Candidate states that the same mutable fact has changed over time. Keep the old memory as historical but no longer current, and create a new current memory.
- SUPPORT: Candidate reinforces/confirms an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. "still prefers tea in the evening")
- CONTEXTUALIZE: Candidate adds a situational nuance to an existing memory (e.g. existing: "likes coffee", candidate: "prefers tea at night" — different context, same topic)
- CONTRADICT: Candidate directly contradicts an existing memory in a specific context (e.g. existing: "runs on weekends", candidate: "stopped running on weekends")

IMPORTANT:
- "events" and "cases" categories are independent records — they do NOT support MERGE/SUPERSEDE/SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT. For these categories, only use SKIP or CREATE.
- If the candidate appears to be derived from a recall question (e.g., "Do you remember X?" / "你记得X吗？") and an existing memory already covers topic X with equal or more detail, you MUST choose SKIP.
- A candidate with less information than an existing memory on the same topic should NEVER be CREATED or MERGED — always SKIP.
- For "preferences" and "entities", use SUPERSEDE when the candidate replaces the current truth instead of adding detail or context. Example: existing "Preferred editor: VS Code", candidate "Preferred editor: Zed".
- For SUPPORT/CONTEXTUALIZE/CONTRADICT, you MUST provide a context_label from this vocabulary: general, morning, evening, night, weekday, weekend, work, leisure, summer, winter, travel.

Return JSON format:
{
  "decision": "skip|create|merge|supersede|support|contextualize|contradict",
  "match_index": 1,
  "reason": "Decision reason",
  "context_label": "evening"
}

- If decision is "merge"/"supersede"/"support"/"contextualize"/"contradict", set "match_index" to the number of the existing memory (1-based).
- Only include "context_label" for support/contextualize/contradict decisions.`;
